This project started with code in place for a single eye that follows the mouse movement. 
The goal was to create a second eye and mimic the tracking of the mouse with "eye movements".
This incorporated understanding of Javascript and incorporation of CSS to allow for a more dynamic experience.
The "Big Eyes.html" link will lead to the completed project. 
In the future, I look forward to progressing this to a full face, hopefully allowing for motion of other facial features when indicated by the mouse.
